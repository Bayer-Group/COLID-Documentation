# Quick start

To run the COLID application on your local computer is very easy. We created a setup project which will provide you with a preconfigured Docker Compose environment with all components and underlying infrastructure. Basically you only need to follow the following steps:
*  You need to have a Docker installation on your local machine.
*  Clone the [Setup Repository](https://github.com/Bayer-Group/COLID-Setup).
*  Build and startup the enviroment on your local machine.

For more details on the installation of the COLID application checkout the [Setup Repository](https://github.com/Bayer-Group/COLID-Setup) which contains also step by stepy instructions.
